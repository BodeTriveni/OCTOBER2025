pseudocode for heighest length of rectangle in histogram:


for i,h in enumerate(hs):
    start=i
    while st and st[-1][1]>h:
          idx,h1=st.pop()
          ma=max(ma,h1*(i-idx))
          start=idx
st.append((start,h))
for idx,h in st:
       ma=max(ma,h*(n-idx))


ordered dictionary:
 it is part of collections.
if i need to use it i need to import collections. to maintain the relative order of the inserting keys.
again in this i will have a built in function called move_2_end()
